Our hens have started laying up a storm! Okay, so I guess that may be a bit dramatic. For the past few days our 22 hens are laying about 6 eggs each day. But to go from a dozen eggs a week (because organic eggs are so expensive to buy) to a dozen eggs every two days, well, it feels like we’re rolling in eggs!

At this point, some of the eggs are actually normal size as compared to the tiny barely-bigger-than-a-robin-egg eggs a hen gives when she first starts laying. But until they are all “real” size, we aren’t offering any for sale. Hopefully in a few weeks we’ll have enough to sell a few dozen a week.

In the meantime, we’ve been eating lots of eggs. Quiche, scrambled, fried, in baked goods, just about anywhere I can throw them in! Which brought me to one of my favorite things to make: homemade pasta. I follow the “2 eggs per 1 cup of flour and a pinch of salt” recipe – very exact, I know. And when I make it, I like to make enough for dinner plus to dry for later use since it is a little labor intensive.

1. Keeping the ingredient ratio (2 eggs per 1 cup of flour) mix ingredients together for as much as you want to make. Some people say it’s 1 egg per person (so a single batch makes enough for 2 people) but since I’m not really exact about stuff like this I just make as much as the amount of eggs I have handy.

2. Knead it a little until its a shiny and elastic. I use my KitchenAid with the bread hook.

3. Let it sit for 30 minutes or so. It can be a little longer if you, say, get busy on playing on the computer and forget to set the timer. Just a note: Sometimes it dries out fast so I always cover the dough with a damp cloth whenever I’m not working with it to keep it fresh,

4. There are different methods for rolling the dough out nice and thin. Being a wee bit lazy I use my KitchenAid Pasta Roller. I usually roll out two sheets before moving onto the next step.

5. There are also lots of ways to cut the pasta. Again, it’s me so I use my KitchenAid Pasta Cutter attachment.

7. After a few hours, the pasta is dry. It looks like a pair of tongs since it was folded in half on the rack. I just snap it into 2 pieces and put them in a container to use later. Or I toss it into a pot of boiling water for a few minutes to have some delicious fresh, homemade pasta!

Last night I grabbed some basil from the garden, threw in some olive oil, walnuts, garlic, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper and a squirt of lemon  juice for a delicious pesto. I made enough pesto to freeze some (although my pesto making/freezing days are just getting started!).

Dry pasta and frozen pesto – not a bad way to preserve the bounty of eggs and basil.
