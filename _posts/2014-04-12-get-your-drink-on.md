Get your muddle on with any kind of fruit if it’s not quite cherry time yet. Aperol helps give the drink its pretty color. Get the recipe at Pinch of Yum

The ginger beer makes this a little lighter than your average marg (and thus fully appropriate for daylight hours). Get the recipe

## Aperol Spritz

Aperol is lovely because it’s got the complexity of other, stronger bitter-ish aperitifs, but is low-alc enough that you won’t pass out before dinner. Get the recipe

## Clementine Cocktail

Sounds weird, but something about bittersweet Campari + bitter/fizzy beer = hot damn, that’s refreshing. I’m on a quest to train every bartender in the world to appreciate this drink.

Marcus Nilsson / bonappetit.com
This sassy tequila-based drink takes a little doing because you have to make a spicy lime “shrub” syrup (shrub = involves vinegar), but after that it’s a snap. Get the recipe
