While it may not be the best idea to snack all day if your goal is to lose weight, you need to keep your brain fed while going into deep study sessions.

Of course, for these benefits to be valid, we must always pay attention to the food or preparation we choose, being appropriate to eat a snack low in saturated and trans fats, many vitamins, minerals and fiber. Therefore, eating healthy snacks can provide the following benefits:

- Prevents sudden changes in glycemia during the day by providing the body with healthy substrates that keep it energized to continue its activities.
- It promotes daily calorie control by reducing hunger at main meals and can thus become an effective weight loss resource.
- It keeps our body occupied in digestive processes and the organism acquires an appropriate rhythm of work for the meals and keeps under control the appetite.
- It offers one more possibility to incorporate healthy nutrients such as vitamins, antioxidants, minerals, fiber, water, because if we choose correctly, we can reach a perfect balance and meet our daily needs with the help of snacks.

Far from what we think, the habit of eating small bites of food between meals is not harmful to our organism, but it brings great benefits as long as we choose a healthy snack that feeds us intelligently and calms our appetite in a healthy way.

Here is a list of easy, quick, and relatively cheap snacks that you should try making when you don't have time for anything else.

Here’s a reason to get excited about a classic-old combo: bananas — a darling energy-boosting carbohydrate — wrapped in wheat tortillas and peanut butter.
 
## Mason Jar Hummus and Veggies


Mason jar fanatic or not, you can’t deny that this method syncs with gravity: It’s a mess-free way to transport your high-protein hummus and veggies in one container. If you're not a fan of hummus, you can do the same with other bean-based dips (pinto bean, black bean, etc.)

Apples and Greek yogurt fortified with peanut butter is a power couple snack. AND you should use the apple slicer you bought but are always too lazy to pull out — because right now you need a reason to procrastinate.

A NEW SIMPLE WAY TO EAT BROCCOLI? Yes. Steam and eat with a five-ingredient dip: miso, peanut butter, rice vinegar, mirin, and sesame oil. Make the sauce in bulk ahead of time and keep in the fridge. That way you get several snack/study seshes out of it and you don’t have to eat boring broccoli just because you’re under pressure.

## Toasted Pumpkin Seeds
