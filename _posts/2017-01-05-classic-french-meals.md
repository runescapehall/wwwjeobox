It is a Camembert. And it is BAKED. What more do you need to know? Find the recipe here What to drink: A red Bordeaux. For dessert: A tarte tatin, a French apple pie, to end the meal on a sweet and light note. Here is the recipe.



## 3. Moules Marinières


The association between mussels and french fries is a Belgian 
specialty, but it’s very widespread in France and we brought our own 
twist to the recipe. There are many ways to cook mussels, my favorite is
the moules marinières, a recipe from the west of France where you cook 
the mussels in a white wine broth with shallots and parsley. Here is the recipe
What to drink: A blond Belgian ale, or a white wine. For dessert: A 
clafoutis, traditionally made with cherries but you can switch them for 
rhubarb. Find two (very easy) recipes here and here

## 6. Soupe à L’oignon

The queen of all soups. This is how New York Times food critic 
Amanda Hesser described it: “It is one of the strangest and most 
delicious soup recipes I’ve encountered. … By the time it is done, the 
‘soup’ is like a savory bread pudding and the top has a thick, golden 
crust that your guests will fight to the death over.” Here is the new recipe
What to drink: A Beaujolais. For dessert: Chocolate éclairs. The real 
ones are filled with chocolate cream and not vanilla custard like most 
recipes in English would have you believe. Here is a good recipe



## 7. Sole Meunière

You don’t need fancy preparations to get an awesome result, 
especially when it comes to fish. Sole meunière is thus a very 
straightforward and easily prepared recipe. The final dish is flavorful,
crispy, buttery, and lemony, all at once. Here is the recipe.

Kouign-amann, a deliciously caramelized specialty from Brittany. Find 
the recipe here



## 8. Hachis Parmentier

A layer of mashed potatoes and a layer of juicy ground beef (or, as I
like to call them, two layers of heaven). Hachis Parmentier is often 
described as a French version of shepherd’s pie. It is French comfort 
food at its best and it is fairly easy to prepare. Check out the recipe here
What to drink: A red wine, something like an Alsacian pinot noir. For 
dessert: A crème brûlée. It’s delicious, fun to prepare, and a perfect 
way to warm up a cold winter night. Here is the recipe



## 9. Boudin Noir Aux Pommes

Boudin noir is a blood sausage. If you’re not repelled by the 
concept, you’re in for a treat. There are several varieties of boudin 
(in the French Caribbean they produce a delicious spicy blood sausage 
that’s worth the trip alone). The traditional French boudin noir is 
excellent on its own or served with baked apples. Here is the recipe. What to drink: A red Bordeaux. For dessert: A pithiviers, an almond-flavored cake. Here is the recipe



## 10. Cheese Soufflé


Like Audrey Hepburn’s culinary school instructor in
Sabrina puts it: “The soufflé it must be gay, gay, gay. Like two 
butterflies dancing the waltz in the summer breeze.” Doesn’t it make you
want to channel your inner French chef? Here is the recipe
What to drink: Both a red Beaujolais and a white riesling would work. 
For dessert: Some salted butter caramels. Find the recipe here



## 11. Steak Tartare

When you eat steak tartare, you’re eating meat the way it is 
supposed to be eaten: raw. Don’t be scared and unleash your primal 
instinct. Here is the recipe What to drink: A red Bordeaux. For dessert: A French apple cake. Here is the recipe.



## 12. Pot-au-feu

This beef and vegetable stew is the ultimate French winter dish. 
You’ll have a hard time finding anything more heartwarming and 
comforting (except for cassoulet). Here is the recipe. What to drink: A red wine, like a cabernet franc. For dessert: A far breton, a prune cake from Brittany. Find the recipe here


## 13. Piperade

Piperade is a specialty from the French Basque country. It is a 
little bit like ratatouille, except not really since you use mostly 
onions and peppers for the Basque specialty. Bake a few eggs in the dish
and you’re in for a treat. Find the recipe here
What to drink: A cabernet sauvignon. For dessert: A gâteau Basque, the 
most famous and delicious pastry from the French Basque Country. Here is the recipe.



## 14. Magret de Canard

Magret is French for duck breast. The secret here is in the cook of 
the meat. You want the meat to be bloody for it to be good. Here is the recipe. What to drink: A red Bordeaux. For dessert: A yogurt cake, the simplest cake recipe ever. Find it here



## 15. Garbure

It’s a southwestern stew made of ham, cabbage, and other vegetables. It’s both comforting and delicious. Here is the recipe. What to drink: A tannat. For dessert: A pastis landais, a sweet brioche from the same area as the garbure. Here is a recipe.



## 16. Cassoulet

A legendary French chef once said this duck and beans stew was the 
god of southwestern French food. He was wrong. Cassoulet is the god of 
ALL FOODS. Nothing — and I mean NOTHING — can match the comfort brought 
to you by a good cassoulet. It is the most heartwarming and delicious 
dish there is. Making a good cassoulet takes some time and effort, but 
it’s all worth it. Find a recipe here and here
. What to drink: A red wine, preferably from the southwest of France. 
For dessert: A French apple tart. You can’t really go wrong with this 
classic. Here is the recipe.



## 17. Pan-seared Foie Gras

You may think the way we make foie gras is cruel. And maybe you’re 
right. But there is no better way to soothe the guilt than to taste 
pan-seared foie gras. Foie gras paté is delicious, but pan-seared foie 
gras is unique and amazing. The hardest part of this recipe is finding a
fresh whole foie gras at a local store. Once you have it, the recipe is
actually fairly easy and the result mind-blowing. Here is the recipe.
What to drink: Both red and white wines work well this dish. A red 
Bordeaux will be nice, but you may also want to try a sweet white wine. 
For dessert: A French lemon tart to end on a fresh and sweet note. Find 
the recipe, here



## 18. Confit de Canard

I don’t know who had the idea to cook a duck in its own fat, but 
that genius should be canonized. Even the strongest atheist will believe
in God after tasting this specialty, especially if it’s served with 
duck fat-fried potatoes. Here is the recipe. What to drink: A red Bordeaux. For dessert: A French strawberry pie. Here is a recipe.



## 19. Poulet Basquaise

This chicken, pepper, and tomato stew from the French Basque country
was a favorite of Julia Child. It’s simple, straightforward, and, you 
guessed it, comforting. Here is the recipe. What to drink: A red Bordeaux. For dessert: A Basque pumpkin cornbread. Here is the recipe



## 20. Lamprey à la Bordelaise

This dish is not for everyone and the preparation itself is quite gruesome. You have to bleed a lamprey — aka the ugliest animal EVER
—and collect the blood that you then use in the sauce along with red 
wine. It was already served in some parts of France in the Middle Ages 
and became widespread in most European courts in the 17th century. Find the recipe here.
What to drink: A Bordeaux supérieur. For dessert: Cannelés, a specialty
from Bordeaux. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, with a 
subtle taste of rum and vanilla. Here is the recipe.

## 21. Quenelles of Pike with Lobster Sauce

The first time I tasted quenelles of pike I heard angels sing. This 
specialty from Lyon is rich — and if you’re watching your cholesterol 
you should try something else — but it is never heavy. The texture is 
light and fluffy and the pike flavor very subtle. But it is the lobster 
sauce that brings the whole thing to an enchanting dimension. Find a 
recipe, here. And here is how a French chef prepares quenelles. 

What to drink: A chardonnay. For dessert: Some bugnes lyonnaises , a sweet treat from Lyon. Here is the recipe.



## 22. Soupe de Poisson à la Rouille

This fish soup was born in Marseille. It used to be a fishermen’s 
dish, so the fish involved in its preparation is pretty cheap. Tomatoes 
and saffron give it a beautiful color. The final, and crucial, touch is 
the “rouille,” a saffron mayonnaise that goes on top. Find the recipe here.
What to drink : My grandmother, who makes a killer fish soup, told me a
rosé was in order. For the wine snobs who roll their eyes at the 
mention of rosé, a Provence white wine will also work very well. For 
dessert : Navettes de Marseille, a sweet pastry flavored with orange 
blossom water. It is shaped like a boat, to stick with the fishing 
theme. Here is the recipe.



## 23. Gigot D’Agneau Pleureur

A “crying lamb gigot.” The meat is cooked in the oven, slowly, on a 
grill, with the potatoes placed on a rack underneath it. The meat’s 
juices fall on the potatoes and cook them. Find a recipe here
What to drink: A red Médoc wine. For dessert: Profiteroles , cream 
puffs filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with hot chocolate sauce.


## 24. Bouillabaisse

This saffron-flavored stew is the most iconic dish from Marseille 
and it shares the warmth of the city. It involves four different types 
of fish and a variety of shellfish. It’s a classic that will be 
appreciated by all seafood lovers. Here is a recipe.
What to drink: A white or a rosé from Provence. For dessert: A Beaumes 
de Venise cake with grapes, named after a little town in the Vaucluse. Recipe here.



## 25. Pissaladière

Pissaladière is a pizza with onion, olives, and anchovies. Beautifully simple and totally delicious. Here is the recipe. What to drink: A rosé. For dessert: A tarte tropézienne, which is basically a giant cream puff. Recipe here and here



## 26. Soupe au Pistou

This soup is a specialty from Provence made with the French version of pesto. It’s both comforting and flavorful. Here is the recipe. What to drink: A red or rosé wine from Provence. For dessert: Some macarons, just because they’re really good. Recipe here



## 27. Ratatouille

This dish is so famous it even had a Pixar movie named after it, but
I couldn’t possibly write a post about French food without including 
it. So there you go. Here is the recipe.
What to drink: A red wine or a rosé from the south of France. A merlot 
will work well too. For dessert: French almond nougat, one of the best 
French candies. To be honest, I’m not sure making it at home is very 
realistic, but if you feel adventurous, you can try this recipe



## 28. Roasted Chicken and Garlic

Roasted chicken with potatoes is the traditional Sunday lunch in 
France, whether you buy it already roasted at the local farmers market 
or you make it at home. There are several recipes, but my favorite 
includes whole garlic cloves roasted with the chicken. When you eat the 
chicken you crush the roasted cloves on the meat. It’s unbelievably 
good. Here is the recipe.

What to drink: Pretty much any red wine goes with that one. For 
dessert: Another French classic, the religieuse — pastry cream, 
chocolate ganache and whipped cream. Here is the recipe



## 29. Navarin D’Agneau

It’s kind of a lighter (but equally delicious) version of boeuf 
bourguignon. Except that it’s made with lamb, white wine, and spring 
vegetables. Here is the recipe.
What to drink: Although it’s made with white wine, a pinot noir is the 
best option to go with the dish. For dessert: A French fig tart. Find 
the recipe here



## 30. Foie de Veau à la Lyonnaise

Calf liver. It may not sound appetizing at first but if you prepare 
it well it will wow your taste buds. In Lyon, they make it with 
caramelized onions, but you can also use shallots. Another option is to 
sauté the liver with parsley and garlic. Here is the recipe for the veal liver with caramelized shallots . And one for the garlic and parsley option

What to drink: A merlot from Bordeaux. For dessert: A Saint Honoré, a 
pastry composed of cream puffs, pastry cream, and whipped cream. Believe
 me, your life is meaningless until you try this wonder. Here is a recipe.



## 31. Aligot

Mashed potatoes with melted cheese and garlic. Native to the Aubrac,
a volcanic region with deserted granite landscapes in the center of 
France, it is an ideal comfort food. Here is a recipe. What to drink: A cabernet sauvignon. For dessert: Some madeleines, Marcel Proust’s favorite delicacy (he is not alone). Here is a recipe.



## 32. Fondue Savoyarde

Melted cheese with white wine and garlic served in a communal pot 
where everyone dips their bread. This typical dish from the French Alps 
is very convivial and a perfect way to feed a group of friends after a 
long winter day. Find the recipe here. What to drink: A chardonnay. For dessert: A Savoy cake, a specialty from the same region as the fondue. Here is the recipe.



## 33. Tartiflette

A luxurious potato dish from the French Alps made with melted 
cheese, lardons (French bacon), and onions. Do you really need more 
convincing? Here is Anthony Bourdain’s recipe. What to drink: A white wine from Savoie. For dessert: A baba au rhum , a rum-soaked dessert. Here is the recipe.



## 34. Gratin Dauphinois

An authentic gratin dauphinois doesn’t have any cheese. It is just 
made of sliced potatoes baked in milk, or cream. The preparation is easy
and the result always satisfying. Here is a recipe.

What to drink: A red wine, like a Beaujolais. For dessert: To end the 
meal on a light touch, some homemade fromage blanc with some seasonal 
fruits. Here is a recipe.

## 35. Coq au Vin

This may be one of the most famous French dishes in the U.S., thanks
to Julia Child’s book Mastering the Art of French Cooking. It was 
originally made with a rooster, but chicken is now more commonly used. 
It is cooked in a red wine sauce with bacon, butter, and beef stock. And
it is ridiculously delicious. Find the recipe here.

What to drink : If you can, a pinot noir from Bourgogne. Otherwise an 
American pinot noir should do the trick. For dessert : A chocolate 
mousse. Because, why not? Here is the recipe.



## 36. Flammekueche

A thin-crust pizza with crème fraîche, onions, and bacon that comes 
from Alsace, the French region at the border with Germany. It won’t help
you achieve your daily intake of vegetables but no vegetable tastes 
this good. Here is the recipe. What to drink: A Gewürztraminer, an Alsatian wine. For dessert: A kouglof , an Alsatian brioche. Find the recipe here.



## 37. Raclette

Another brilliant melted cheese specialty. It is originally from 
Switzerland but it’s a very common winter dish in France, where regions 
such as Savoie and France-Comté make a cheese very close to the Swiss 
raclette. It may be one of of the easiest meals to prepare — you just 
cover baked potatoes, ham and salami with the melted cheese. It’s 

obviously delicious. Here is a recipe that doesn’t require a raclette maker. What to drink: A red wine from Savoie. For dessert: A Mont-Blanc, a dessert made with chestnut cream and meringue. Here is a recipe.



## 38. Choucroute Garnie

This generous dish is the Alsatian version of sauerkraut with 
sausages, pork ribs, and potatoes. A nice and hearty family dinner. Here is the recipe.
What to drink: A riesling. For dessert: A männele , an Alsatian brioche
that is traditionally made to celebrate Saint Nicholas. Find the recipe here.



## 39. Baeckeoffe

Back in the days when laundry machines were not even a dream, women 
used to spend one day a week washing clothes. They didn’t have time to 
cook that day so they would make baeckeoffe ahead of time, cover the 
dish with a bread batter and leave it at the local bakery on their way 
to the lavoir . The baker would leave the dish in the oven to bake for 
the rest of the day. Even though the days of the lavoir are over, 
baeckeoffe is still around because it’s fucking amazing. Here is the recipe.

What to drink: A pinot noir. For dessert: A damson pie, another 
specialty from Alsace. I couldn’t find a recipe in English for the 
Alsatian version, but here is one from Luxembourg that’s very similar (the recipe measurements are in the metric system).



## 40. Quiche Lorraine

A classic and one of the easiest recipes on this list, it is always a
hit. The secret is to achieve the perfect balance between the soft and 
creamy batter and the salty and crunchy bacon. Perfect if you feel like 
cooking but don’t have much time. Here is a recipe. What to drink: A dry white wine such as an Alsatian pinot gris. For dessert: A mirabelle plum and almond frangipane tart. Here is the recipe.



## 41. Boeuf Bourguignon

Its name may be hard to pronounce but boeuf bourguignon is always 
easy to eat. It is basically a delicious red wine beef stew. It is also 
one of the rare dishes that is even better the second day. So if you’re 
hosting a dinner and want to cook in advance, this is a perfect option. Find a recipe here. What to drink: A red from Bourgogne. For dessert: An île flottante . Find the recipe here



## 42. Escargots

Snails with butter, garlic, and parsley. If it grosses you out, good. That just leaves more for us. Find the recipe here What to drink: A Bourgogne aligoté. For dessert: A raspberry charlotte. Here is the recipe.



## 43. Gougères

Gougères are cheese puffs. If you need any more convincing then maybe you don’t deserve to try them. Here is the recipe. What to drink: Red or white wine, doesn’t really matter. For dessert: Some meringue cookie bites. Find the recipe, here


## 44. Cod Accras

As a friend of mine puts it: “No one really likes cod but somehow 
everyone loves cod accras.” These deep-fried French Caribbean 
specialties can be served as appetizers or in a sandwich. They are very 
good and highly addictive. Here is a recipe. What to drink: Ti’Punch
, a rum cocktail from the French Caribbean. For dessert: Another 
specialty from the French Caribbean, a blanc-manger coco — a delicious 
and refreshing coconut-flavored jelly-like cake. Here is the recipe.
