I thought I would share two of the sausage recipes from my sausage making class. Just a note: the ingredients are given in ounces so you will need an ounce scale that can measure such small amounts. I don’t have one so I may just convert to teaspoons as best I can (unfortunately it doesn’t work out to even teaspoons) and kinda wing it from there.  Enjoy!

Italian Style Pork Sausage

This is a course ground fresh sausage. It can be pan-fried or broiled or thrown onto the grill. I actually removed it from the casing and fried it in my cast iron skillet to use as a pizza topping. It is yummy but definitely spicy!

Ingredients:

    10.0 lbs lean pork trimmings (70% lean)
    2.4 oz salt
    0.4 oz fennel seed
    0.4 oz crushed red pepper
    0.4 oz chopped fresh parsley (optional)
    0.2 oz ground black pepper
    0.2 oz paprika
    0.2 oz coriander (optional)
    2 garlic cloves, minced (optional)

Directions:

    Grind the pork trimmings through a 1/2 inch or 3/8 inch plate.
    Mix the seasonings with the trimmings for 3-5 minutes or until tacky.
    Regrind through a 1/4 inch or 3/8 inch plate.
    Stuff in natural hog casings or collagen casings.
    Package and keep refrigerated below 40°F or freeze.

Fresh Pork Sausage

We made these into little breakfast-style sausage links. We used the milder recipe since we also made the spicy Italian Pork Sausage listed above.

Ingredients:

    1o.0 lbs pork trimmings (20-50% lean)
    If you want milder seasonings:
        3.0 oz salt
        0.7 oz sugar
        0.5 oz white pepper
        0.2 oz ginger
        0.15 oz rubbed sage
    If you want spicy seasonings:
        3.2 oz salt
        0.8 oz monosodium glutamate (I have no idea what this is)
        0.6 oz sugar
        0.6 oz white pepper
        0.15 oz rubbed sage
        0.15 oz ginger
        0.4 oz mace
        0.4 oz thyme
        0.4 oz red pepper (this can be varied depending on your taste)

Directions:

    Grind through a 1/2 inch or 3/8 inch plate.
    Mix spices with trimmings for 3-5 minutes or until tacky.
    Regrind through a 3/16 inch plate.
    Package in bulk form, stuff in natural hog casings or collagen casings.
    Keep refrigerated below 40°F or freeze.
