There are a wide variety of cultures and countries in West Africa, from Nigeria through to Senegal, but one thing is the same for them all: life there is very different than life in the United States. Going for a drive through West Africa could result in goat herds, flash floods, vigilantes and danger.

One man’s collection of photos shows just how alien that life is compared to the Western world.
