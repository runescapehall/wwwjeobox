Ever wanted to make a 15 pound Snicker’s chocolate candy bar? Of course you have. Who hasn’t? Well, thanks to one guy who decided to take things to the next, ridiculous level, you can get on that anytime you want.
Warning: You’ll gain 15 pounds just looking at these pictures.

Before starting this diabetes inducing undertaking, you’ll need candy, and some more candy. All the candy seen here basically.


Melt the chocolate and butterscotch chips along with some spoonfuls of peanut butter.

It should look like this.

Now coat the bottom of your mold like so.

In the words of rapper Xzibit: “Yo Dog, I heard you like Snickers, so I put Snickers in your Snickers, so you can eat Snickers while you eat your Snickers.”

Nutella is the glue that holds it all together.

Next step, take these three bad boys and melt them down into something delicious and magical.

Something delicious and magical like this.

Give that Snickers some nuts. Snickers love nuts.

Next, add even more Snickers…even our friend Xzibit was like; “Yo dog…I think you’re goin’ a bit too far with the Snickers”.

Now it’s time to make the nougat.

It should melt down into something that looks like this.

Another Snickers pool, this time with the nougat.

Awesome! You’re almost there. Now just add the base chocolate layer. It should be an extra thick chocolate foundation to support the heart stopping 15 pound 400billion calorie chocolate death machine!

The final step, stick that bad boy in the freezer for about 2 hours. It should look a bit like this when you take it back out.

Unfortunately, there is no picture of it cut into nor the bakers (psychos?) enjoying it. To see what it looks like you’ll just have to make one for yourself. Just have your phone ready if you decide to eat it because you may need emergency paramedics.
