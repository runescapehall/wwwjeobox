Chen Xiaotian was only 7 when he was diagnosed with the brain tumor that would kill him. If that wasn’t enough bad news for his family, his mother Zhou Lu was diagnosed with kidney disease. They both would need to struggle just to live a shadow of the life everyone else has.<br>
So, Chen made a brave decision as he got worse. He asked his mother just to let him die… so that she may live.</p>

Before the surgery to remove the kidney, the doctors had a moment of silence in the operating room. There wasn’t a dry eye as they said goodbye to heroic Chen, who was about to save the life of his mother and two other recipients of his organs.<br>
Chen’s sacrifice and bravery are incredible, please share his story.</p>
