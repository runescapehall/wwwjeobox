Whether you are on a romantic getaway, travelling for business, or in a biking expedition, Iowa has a number of bed and breakfasts that can provide you with comfortable, safe, and convenient accommodations. These B&Bs range in style from historic properties that are restored to their old glory; farmhouses converted and furnished with modern amenities; to buildings newly constructed for the sole purpose of providing luxurious accommodations to guests. With this in mind, you are actually spoilt for choice.

Here is a sampling of the B&Bs operating in different areas in Iowa. Each establishment offers comfortable accommodations and, of course, sumptuous breakfasts.

Hearten B & B in Algona is an early 20th century house renovated to provide lodgings for guests. Built in 1913, it was home to the first surgeon of Algona. Today, if you are a guest, you will experience comfortable accommodations equipped with spacious beds and a whirlpool.

In Altoona, Victoria’s Vineyard offers bed and breakfast as well. The establishment is nestled within an 80-acre farm that has a hardwood forest. The onsite vineyard is where the place got its name. It is also conveniently located just minutes from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and the Adventureland Amusement Park.

Amana is a historic village that was previously home to late 19th century German immigrants. Annie’s Garden and Guest House is just a few minutes’ walk from Amana museum, shops, and dining establishments. This bed and breakfast offers spacious rooms and a patio surrounded by a garden, where guests can unwind after a full day of exploring the sites of Amana.

The uniquely named ‘The Inn of the Six-Toed Cat’ in Allerton is a restored 1909 hotel that is decorated with period antiques and features nearly 20 feet of embossed tin ceiling. Guests can sit at the establishment’s porch swing while enjoying the scenery around the property.

Mason House Inn of Bentonsport was built by Mormons in 1846. The steamboat river bed and breakfast provides guests with large-sized beds that ensure a good night’s rest. Guests will also be delighted to know that there is a cookie jar in every room.

The Black Horse Inn is another bed and breakfast that has an authentic historical background. The inn is one of a dwindling number of establishments that has been operating since before the American Civil War. It is located near Dubuque, in the Mississippi River bluff country.

As a general tip: appreciating the diversity of personalities that you will get to meet in a B&B is the key to enjoying your stay in this kind of establishment, which often give travelers the feeling as if they never left home.
