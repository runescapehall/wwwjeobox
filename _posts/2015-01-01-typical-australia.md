## 6.  Day off for the queen's birthday

Although the British do not take a day off for the queen's birthday. The Australians do. Perhaps it is due to one of those strange traditions that still exist in colonial times; however, Australians surely do not oppose their place in their culture and customs.

## 7.  Footy

One of the most well known Australian sports is Australian Rules Football or "Footy" a fast, fluid game and is the most popular sport in Australia. The game seems to be a hybrid of rugby and soccer with a bit of basketball, field hockey, lacrosse and volleyball.  The game dates back to the 1850s in Melbourne, Australia, before the formation of the Football Association and the Rugby Union in England. It is played on an oval that is approximately twice the length of a soccer field and as wide as a soccer field along.

There are 18 players on each side or team. The goal is to kick the ball between the two intermediate posts located at each end. A goal is scored if the ball is kicked through the center posts and is worth 6 points. If the goal is kicked between the center post and the smaller side post or if the ball goes between the center posts without being kicked, then only 1 point is scored. There is no offside, so players can move anywhere on the field and can pass the ball in any direction. However, they cannot throw the ball.

To pass, a player can kick (clear) the ball or "pass with the hand". A pass is a pass in which the ball is placed in the palm of one hand and hit with the closed fist of the other hand.

8.  Everyday words and phrases
One of the most relevant things typical of Australia is its vocabulary. They always say "How are you doing?": Instead of saying "Hello", it is quite common for an Australian to ask "How are you doing? The important thing is to realize that they don't really want to know how you are, they just want to break the ice to get the conversation going. Australians are known to shorten words or abbreviate everything and have their own jargon.
It is quite difficult for other native speakers to understand what they are saying many times. Part of this is due to their geographical isolation and the other is due to their habit of shortening words. It may all be in the name of more efficient conversation (or perhaps it could be something of laziness). In any case, "Straya" is the way to shorten the name of the country.

Here are some examples:
- Sunnies for (sunglasses)
- Boardies for (surfboards)
- Arvo for (afternoon),
- Exxy for (expensive),
- Avo for (avocado),
- Cuppa for (tea cup),
- Choccy biccy for (chocolate cookie),
- Servo for (gas station),
- Mozzie for (mosquito)

## 9.  ANZAC Day

This day is the commemoration of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) for the fallen people and the efforts made in the First World War. It takes place every year on April 25th and for this date Australians make Anzac cookies as typical Australian treats, to remember the diet during the First World War at the Battle of Gallipoli. They also hold sunrise prayers, church services and parades in recognition of those who served their country.

## To finish...

With all that has been mentioned, you can see that Australians really do have a very diverse culture around the world. For this reason, you should not be surprised of travelers staying longer than their visas allow. In fact, it is absolutely possible to have a very high quality of life while living in Australia. Once you can demonstrate a high level of English and a professional skill that is valuable to the Australian economy, it is absolutely possible to have a rewarding time residing in Australia, either temporarily or more permanently.
