## How Much Does A Tiny House Cost?

The cost of a tiny house depends on quite a few things.  Are you building it yourself or are you paying someone to build it for you?  That will be the biggest determination of cost.  The next biggest determination of cost is the materials and systems you choose to have in your house.  A tiny house with laminated floors, stock windows and no heating/cooling systems will obviously be much less than houses with high end flooring, custom windows and built in heating and air. When we work with our clients we are able to help them to understand the pros and cons of the materials they choose for their house.  We are able to empower them make informed decisions on what things are worth the money, while others might have a less expensive alternative.  When it comes to the decisions that need to be made while building a tiny house, there are thousands of them, that's the value we bring to the table, we can help you navigate them quickly and get you into your house sooner.

## I Want To Use A Used Trailer, Can I?

This is a common thing that people want to try, but we generally recommend against it.  We have personally talked to a few dozen people who have tried using used trailers and literally every single one of them said in the end it wasn't worth it.  They all either didn't end up saving much money, while some spent more than a new trailer.  Many of the people who went this route have to replace or upgrade axles, breaks and tires.    The other thing that comes into play when you use a second hand trailer is that you don't always know what you are getting, where a new trailer from a reputable manufacture produces a consistent product.

## I Saw Someone Who Built A Tiny House For $5,000, Can You Do That?

Simply put, sure we could, but we won't because it would be the wrong way to do it.   Tiny Houses have been built by the owner for few thousand dollars, but the examples we have seen had serious design flaws that were major safety concerns.  In other cases they had certain resources that most people won't have available to them; things like a well appointed lumber shop, they happened to be welders and their family owned a lumber business.   There have been people who have tried to use used trailers, but again, all the examples we have seen, we had major safety concerns with.   For those who are looking to build their tiny house inexpensively, let us help you make decisions on where to best allocate your dollars to build a quality house, that is safe, but affordable at the same time.
