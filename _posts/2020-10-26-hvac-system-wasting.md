[Heating and air conditioning in California](https://primehomesolutions.com/hvac-service-colusa-ca/) are necessary for every home. We all want to run cold air through the house on those hot summer days, and turn up the heat when temperatures start dropping. 

But do you know how much money you’re wasting when you turn on your HVAC system? Believe it or not, as much as 50% of the energy used to run your system could be wasted. That’s bad for the environment — not to mention money down the drain. 

Want to learn more? Here’s how you can stop the waste and lower your monthly energy bills. 

## Energy-saving HVAC solutions

Modern innovations make HVAC much less wasteful. Investing in any of these solutions is a great way to lower your energy costs and boost the resale value of your home.

Deep buried ducting: By burning your insulated ducts, professional [HVAC installers](https://primehomesolutions.com/hvac-service-colusa-ca/) can prevent heat and cool air from escaping through the ducts. 

Gas and electric water heaters: If you haven’t upgraded the old-school water heater in your home, you’re wasting tons of money and energy. Ask a home solutions company about affordable modern options. 

Insulation: Without the right insulation, temperatures will always escape through your vents and ducts. Modern HVAC insulation is more compact and effective than older home systems. 

## Go green, save money

The benefits of upgrading your HVAC system are more than just financial. Energy-efficient solutions will waste less power in your home and help to lower your carbon footprint. 

Going green is more affordable than most people realize! You don’t have to install expensive solar panels or wind energy — just renovate your HVAC, roofing, and windows and doors to stop wasting energy in your home. 

If you’re ready to lower your bills and reduce your personal impact, call a [Placer home solutions company](https://primehomesolutions.com/hvac-service-colusa-ca/) today.
