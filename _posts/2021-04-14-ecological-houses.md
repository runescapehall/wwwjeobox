For young architect [Macy Miller](https://tinyhouseplans.com/macy-miller/), building a sustainable house from scratch was a challenge. Construction can move around just like a mobile home, and while it remains connected to the power grid for now, the goals for the future are to generate its own electricity and add a chicken coop.

This cozy 22-square-meter home includes an eco-friendly dry toilet, thermal insulation and water filtering. The price of this 18-month self-construction is around 15 thousand dollars, but Macy commented in her blog that this amount is reasonable, since she pays only 93 dollars a month in bills.

In the middle of a mango farm in Thailand, Steve Areen built a beautiful 45 m2 dome house in six weeks for $9,000. His creator built it using cement blocks and clay bricks, but plans to build his next dome house with environmentally friendly materials such as mud and adobe.

Everything about this house has an impact: the beautiful view, the spherical rooms, the colorful terracotta finish and the landscaping work.

Inspired by the Mongolian yurts, this circular house is located in a lush forest clearing. Designed by Rachel Ross, her husband and daughter, the "Magnolia 2300" is a home created on the basis of nature, with natural materials such as bamboo, beeswax and stones.

This environmentally friendly prefabricated house stands out for consuming 30% less electricity thanks to its passive solar design with strongly insulated walls and strategically placed windows.

For a little over $3,000, [Brian Liloia built a house out of cob](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS396870026620110512) (a material very similar to adobe) and wood. Without a bathroom, but very comfortable, the house has an approximate diameter of 6 meters.

This circular house with a green roof, received the help of more than 75 people who participated through a form of work exchange. To make the green roof possible, a plastic membrane had to be installed, which according to the owner was the most expensive material.
