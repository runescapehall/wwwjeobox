A <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140831131225/http://www.reddit.com/user/11023517141" target="_blank">Reddit user</a> was exploring a dark and empty factory when he decided to a take a picture in the dark with the flash on. What he discovered next was absolutely terrifying. If this happened to you, we have a feeling you’d need a change of pants…</p>
<div class="top-image-caption">This is what he saw when he took a picture with the flash… a silhouette at the end of a long hallway.</div>

As I hopped back out into the main factory floor, I could see the faint beams of their flashlights flickering at the bottom of the staircase some 30 yards away. For only a moment, I caught a glance to my right of a darkened tunnel with a circular arch above it, and red and orange pipes lining either side. It seemed so out of place in the factory floor, like it was new or barely used, maybe some long-forgotten passageway around the hustle and bustle of the Sugar Mill beyond it.<br>
I moved toward the tunnel, readying my camera as I felt the little hairs on the back of my neck stand tall. The cold was setting in, and I could not longer hear my partyâs voices in the distance. I couldnt hear anything but my quiet, careful footstep on a bolt or creaky metal panel. I stood in the entrance, just beneath the arch of the tunnel. It was dark in there, so I popped up my flash on my new camera and held down the trigger, not expecting anything. As I held it down for it to focus and I stared at the tiny, LCD screen I saw it. I saw that tall, dark figure staring straight back at me from the other side of the tunnel.<br>
I couldnt breathe. I couldnât think.<br>
After seeing the photo he took, the photographer decided to investigate, thankfully&nbsp; only discovering a painted outline on the wall at the end of the tunnel.<br>
I don’t know about you, but I wouldn’t have been brave enough to venture down that hallway.</p>
