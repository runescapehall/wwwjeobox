## 17.) Cincinnati’s Abandoned Subway (Ohio):

## 18.) Jatinga (India):
Jatinga is a relatively normal town, but it’s plagued by massive bird “suicides” that happen every September – October. The en masse bird deaths occur at the end of the monsoon months, when on dark, foggy nights the bird populations are attracted to the lights of villages and are then killed by the villagers. In modern times, conservation groups have made an effort to decrease the amount of bird deaths during this season.

## 19.) Akodessewa Fetish Market (Togo): 
Over half of the population of Togo practices indigenous beliefs, requiring religious paraphernalia you would not find in any normal market. Shrunken heads, skulls, flesh and more can be found in a fetish market like this.

Some of the strangest places on earth aren’t legitimately haunted, instead they are haunted by the memories of the horrors that were once committed there. The absence of life and positivity in a place that is just an archaic link to the past can be more chilling than any ghost story.
