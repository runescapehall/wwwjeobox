When you make solar panels you are not only providing your home or business with cheap and pollution free energy that saves you money on your electric bills, but you are also helping to reduce our use of such non renewable resources such as oil, coal, and natural gas, and you are reducing the amount of greenhouse gasses released into the atmosphere from burning these non renewable resources. So, in short when you make solar panels you are achieving a lot of worthwhile things. One more nice thing about solar energy is that you can store it for later use, like when it is cloudy out, at night, or if the power grid is down. But, how do you store this energy?

The way energy is stored when you make solar panels is usually in heavy duty batteries that you connect to the solar panels. Unfortunately these batteries can be very expensive costing several hundred dollars. Luckily, there are ways to get these batteries at discounts, or if you’re lucky free.

You can buy batteries at a discount from places like eBay or other auction sites. You can buy old batteries and restore them to working condition. There are guides that will show you how to restore old batteries to like new condition. You can find these guides online, just like you can find the guides on how to make solar panels. For example, Earth4Energy is a guide on how to make solar panels, that includes a section on how to find batteries cheap or even free. It also teaches you everything you need to know about installing the batteries, wiring them to connect with the rest of your solar panel system, with lots of diagrams and how to videos to help you.

If you take time to find the batteries at a discount, and follow the other secrets to make solar panels cheap that these guides teach, you can expect to save thousands on a full scale home solar system.

Just imagine what you can accomplish if you work hard. You will be helping the environment and future generations, by reducing pollution, and preserving nonrenewable resources. You will be saving money every month on your power bill, and improving the value of your home, not to mention it’s attraction to buyers. Plus, you will be acting as an example to your community, and hopefully you will have fun doing it. So, good luck with your goal of learning to make solar panels!
