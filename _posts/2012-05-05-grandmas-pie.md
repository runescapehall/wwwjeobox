Grandma's Homestead Pan Buckeyes
Peanut Butter Base

    1 c. butter or margarine (2 sticks)
    1-1/2 c. peanut butter
    3-1/2 c. powdered sugar (we usually measure then sift flour, but sifting is optional)

Icing

    8 oz. milk chocolate chips
    1/2 c. peanut butter

Line 9"x13" pan with wax paper (with extra on edges to make it easy to lift out). On low heat melt butter and peanut butter. Add powdered sugar and mix. Pat into 9" x 13" pan. To make icing, melt chocolate chips and 1/2 c. peanut butter on low heat. Pour over peanut butter base. Spread evenly. Chill. Cut into 1-1/2" squares. Lift out wax paper so bars can be easily removed and served. These taste as wonderful as regular Buckeyes but can be made in minutes!

Yield: Approx. 48 Buckeyes

Cookie Ingredients

    2/3 c. unsweetened cocoa powder
    1 teaspoon baking soda
    2/3 c. hot water
    2 1/8 c. all-purpose flour
    1 teaspoon baking powder
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    1 1/3 c. light brown sugar
    1/4 c. solid shortening
    1/2 stick butter, softened
    1 large egg
    2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    1/2 c. sour cream

Filling Ingredients

    1/3 c. solid shortening
    1/3 c. butter, softened
    1 3/4 tablespoon corn syrup
    1 c. confectioner's sugar, sifted
    2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    1 (7 oz.) jar marshmallow cream

Preheat oven to 350Â°. Grease baking sheets. Beat together cocoa, baking soda, and hot water with a fork. Mixture will foam and needs to be smooth. Set aside. In a separate bowl sift flour, baking powder and salt. In a third bowl, cream together brown sugar, shortening and butter at medium speed. Add egg and vanilla, and beat until fluffy. Add half of the flour mixture. Stir the sour cream into the cocoa mixture, then combine with already creamed ingredients. Add the remaining flour mixture until well blended.

Drop cookie batter on greased baking sheets 3 inches apart. Use either 1/4 cup measure or soup spoon. Bake cookies for 16-18 minutes until set. If you place your finger at the top of the cookie and it makes a indent they are not done.

To make cookie filling remember more beating is not better. You want a fluffy cookie filling, but over beating can cause separating. Combine shortening, butter, corn syrup, confectioner?s sugar and vanilla, until well blended. Add marshmallow cream and beat until incorporated. Using the filling make a sandwich with two cookies. A great alternative to a ham or turkey sandwich. Go Cookies!

Yield: 12-14 cookie sandwiches
