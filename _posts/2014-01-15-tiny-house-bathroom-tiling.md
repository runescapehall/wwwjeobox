It has been quite a while, dear readers! The last few months have been a whirlwind of building, apartment sale-ing, moving, settling, and working for us. We are very pleased to say though that we are now living full time in this little house of ours! Wow! We had a housewarming party last week that was filled to the brim (quite literally) with people we love dearly. 13 people filled the living room and kitchen while a heaping handful of others lingered about the yard by the fire.

By the way, a fire in front of the tiny house is something I've dreamed of for about two years now, so it's sort of surreal that it actually happened. One of my closest friends signed our wedding guest book, "here's to bonfires outside the tiny house" and I cried. I'm not joking. Bawled like a baby. For a short while at the party I just sat on the porch and watched as all of our dreams came true. Incredible.

If any of you readers were there at the party, a huge, warm, huggy, heartfelt thank you to you. We said at our wedding that without the people we love, the day was just a day, the park was just a field of grass. And without the people we love, our house is just a structure. With you though, it's a home. Love, love, and more love. 

Anyway, before we could have the housewarming we had to finish up a lot of small tasks on the house, one of which was the bathroom floor tile. 

We chose this adorable round white penny tile, an option we thought we wouldn't have because of the weight and the possibility of shifting if and when the house is ever moved. It's such a small area though ( ~ 32" x 48" ), so we decided to take the risk and try it out. 

First we laid down a layer of thinset, followed by some hardie board. The hardie board is scored so that you can simply snap it apart at the length you need. The thinset took a bit of finesse to apply correctly, but it wasn't tough to figure it out. Slap down a scoop of it and spread it around like butter on toast. Then use the toothed side to scrape grooves into the thinset. 

Once the hardieboard was down, we taped over the seam and took some time to arrange the tiles before setting them. The arranging took the most time of the whole process. Since they're such small, round tiles, it's really easy to get a gap in the pattern and suddenly get some weird optical illusions going on. I just took my time and it was mostly alright. I still ended up with some slight gaps, as you'll see down below, but nothing we couldn't live with.

Next step: One more layer of thinset, then lay tiles. Easy, right? Actually, yeah, pretty easy. Since we arranged ahead of time, we knew exactly where everything would lay and only had some minor issues when the gap between the tiles and the shower turned out to be a little wider than we'd anticipated. No worries though, it actually looks pretty nice with grout laid into the gap.

After letting the thinset dry a bit, we started grouting. Similar application process as the thinset, only the trowel is softer to push the grout in between the tiles. Lay one layer down, pulling the trowel at a 45 degree angle, then pull the trowel back over at a 90 degree angle. Come back with a sponge (that has first been wet and rung out) to clean the grout off the tiles. We went back with an even finer clean cloth after the sponge to get the extra haze off and it worked like a charm.

DONE. 

I'm pretty sure this photo was actually taken pre-grout, but the grout dried lighter than it went down and turned out to be closer to this color, which is lovely. Our bathroom ended up being a centerpiece to the house, and each person who came in I was sure to pull in to show the cute tiny tile and the cute tiny sink and our toilet that actually *looks* a little like a real toilet and not a bucket (imagine that!)!

Now that we've moved in, our focus has turned toward the finer details of nesting in a tiny house and getting back to living a real life that isn't centered around building a structure that takes up all of your time, energy, and money. What's that look like? Who knows. We'll share what we find out ;)
