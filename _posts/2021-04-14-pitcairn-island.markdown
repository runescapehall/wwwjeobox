Do you like the idea of Living on an island with very few people? The Pitcairn Islands may be just for you.

The Pitcairn Islands have only 56 residents, with everyone having to contribute labor towards building houses, farming, fishing, and even retreiving supplies that are dropped off by ships.

This kind of life may not be for everyone, but if you feel like taking a shot at living in paradise check out Pitcairn Island. The trick to getting residency there is offering “skills which will be beneficial to the Pitcairn community,” according to [their government website](http://www.government.pn/).

SInce 1838, the pitcairn islands had been a territory of Britain. Most of the residents are descended from the Bounty mutineers that were shipwrecked on the island in 1790. They are mixed between British and Tahitians,
