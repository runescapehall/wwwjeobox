Although Illinois is officially designated as America’s “Prairie State,” the 11 other States that comprise the region known as the American Heartland can all be officially called prairie states. The nickname can be attributed to the prairies that covered most of the region. For reference, here are the 12 states that are located in the country’s heartland (which is also known to most of us as the American Midwest):

- Illinois

- Iowa

- Wisconsin

- North Dakota

- South Dakota

- Ohio

- Nebraska

- Minnesota

- Missouri

- Kansas

- Indiana

- Michigan

So, what is life like in the prairies? Categorically, the area is also known as the breadbasket of America, owing to the large-scale cultivation of wheat, corn, and soybeans. The crops contribute a large part of the food supply of the entire country. In the past, the Midwest was mostly agricultural. Settlers worked the land from one generation to the next. These days, however, many cities in the Midwest are now urbanized. However, there are still areas where residents retain their agricultural/pastoral way of life.

Small towns in Midwestern United States usually have a low incidence of crimes. Real estate companies have consistently reported over the years that the safest places where one can raise a family are located in the Midwest. There are even some Heartland towns where residents don’t lock their doors at night, owing to the general feeling of safety that they have for their community (we don’t recommend this practice for our readers, however, particularly those living in the city).

Compared with other areas in the United States, the Midwest region has a very low unemployment rate. The region is slowly recovering from the migration of their youth to other places that they feel are more fitting for their ambitions, lifestyles, and sense of adventure. Many young people who graduate from universities or colleges seek employment in other regions, thus creating a “brain drain” for their hometown. Midwestern States have now put effort into revitalizing their city centers to make them attractive for their young people, encouraging them to stay in their hometowns rather than seek jobs in other areas.

Owing to its geographical location, the Midwest is known for experiencing the severe weather conditions during the winter months. People visiting these regions might be stunned by their Midwestern winter experience, but long-time residents have already adapted to the vagaries of the season. Despite the coldest winters, America’s Midwest is also known for breathtaking natural sceneries that are well worth visiting. Some local residents would prefer living here just because of the view through their windows: an endless plain bathed in the golden light of a sun making ready to set behind gently rolling hills. To many of them, the Midwest is a slice of paradise.
