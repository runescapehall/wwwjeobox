Have you ever wanted to live in a hobbit house? What about a fairy tale castle or a gingerbread house. Well these 17 cottages below are just about the closest you could ever come to living in a fairy tale home.
In fact they might as well have been taken directly off the pages of a The Brothers Grimm book, they are so true to the magical realms they are created after.
