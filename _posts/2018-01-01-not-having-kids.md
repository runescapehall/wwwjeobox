- 1. You don’t have to share your peanut butter and then see it wasted all over the floor.

- 2. You don’t have to deal with cleaning up you know what.

- 3. You won't have to be embarrased in public.

- 4.  You can decide whether or not you want to decorate the walls.

- 5. And the entire living room.

- 6.  You can sleep without hearing this.

- 7. And you don’t have to worry about your iPad being covered in slobber.

- 8. You can appreciate the joys of Disney World uninterrupted.

- 9. You don’t have to be around people who don’t appreciate food as much as you do.

- 10. Your toilet won’t be clogged.

- 11. And your sink won’t be clogged either.

- 12. You won’t be peed on. (hopefully)

- 13. This won’t happen.

- 14. Nothing will come in between you and your Amazon packages.

- 15. You don’t have to clean up this mess.

- 16. And this isn’t your couch.

- 17. No one will interrupt your TV time.

- 18. Your makeup isn’t currently destroyed and all over someone else’s face.

- 19. And you don’t have to witness a perfectly good cake going to waste.

But if you want to deal with any of this, you can always visit your friends who do have kids and leave when the poop happens.
