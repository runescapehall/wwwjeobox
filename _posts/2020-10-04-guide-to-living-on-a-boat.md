If you are thinking of buying a boat to live on, in this article we help you organize your purchase and guide you so that your decisions will lead you to a good port.

Even if you have previous knowledge about sailing, you should make sure you have chosen the best type of boat for you.

Once acquired, if you already know where you are going to moor it, the next step is to get used to life on board, as this is an important change in many ways.

## Living on a boat

Going from living in a big house, a small studio, or simply a friend's couch to living on a boat is a radical life change, especially because of organizational and space issues. Let's suppose that you have already studied the budget issue and that you know how much a new or second hand boat can cost you.However, if you are not a shipowner and have not done so yet, we recommend that you spend some vacations and weekends living on board a boat with similar characteristics to the one you are planning to buy. 

In the case that you are going to live with someone, it is advisable that you make this first attempt with the person or persons with whom you want to live. Spending long periods of time in the few square meters of a boat is not for everyone or for all families or couples. So your dream has to be shared, even by your dog.

Any moderately free-spirited person's eyes shine at the idea of living on board, since it was once a luxury for bohemian people, although if we go back even further in time, it was something closer to punishment or extreme poverty. However, nowadays there are places where life on board is a symbol, as in the canals of Amsterdam. Although the origin of this modality was due to the lack of housing in the post-war period. But the dream can turn into a nightmare, because to live on a boat you have to learn to be a little minimalist. If you're one of those people unable to give up the spaciousness of a closet or a bathtub, you'd better look for a big boat (and this may not be in your budget) or better stay within brick walls.

## Choosing the type of boat

It is very likely that your decision to live on board comes with a passion for the sea and that you already have previous knowledge of sailing. If so, the transition will be faster and much more satisfactory. But if you are looking for a radical change of life, you have many things to learn and the best thing is to start from the beginning: to know the different types of boats that exist in the nautical market.

First of all, you must decide if you prefer a sailing boat or a motor boat. Each one has its pros and cons. For example, a motorboat offers much larger areas, but nevertheless, maintaining it is much more expensive than a sailboat. Therefore, if your idea is to go out sailing apart from living on board and you don't want to spend a considerable amount of money every time you do it, the ideal would be to opt for a sailboat. Regarding the existing types of boats, there are the classic wooden boats ideal for those who like do-it-yourself, fishing boats for fishing lovers, sport boats to enjoy water sports, etc. 

But if you really prioritize the experience on board rather than the type of navigation you are going to give later, a very good option is a family cruise, as it is the closest thing to a house. In addition, like any type of boat, you can find cruise ships that combine several possibilities, such as, for example, a fishing boat that at the same time is a cruise.

If you have had other boats before, you will probably only have to decide for more length, habitability and stability. In any case, remember that the type of boat you choose and the budget are related. If you are a beginner in the nautical world and you want to sail apart from living in the boat, another point you have to take into account is the type of nautical qualification that the boat you have chosen needs. So, remember that to go out with it, you must start a course to get it first.
